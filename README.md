# pyZabbixSender
Python implementation of zabbix_sender.

*Take a look at the [wiki] page to get in deep details.*

This is a module that allows you to send data to a [Zabbix] server using Python. You don't need the zabbix_sender binary anymore.

Users of the [Twisted] library can use an asynchronous version of the sender.

Has been tested with Python 2.5.1 and 2.7

Python 2.5.1 doesn't have a json module (needed to implement zabbix protocol), so you can use [simplejson] instead.

Installation
------------

Install the package using a pip from the original repository:
```bash
pip install "git+git@github.com:kmomberg/pyZabbixSender.git"
```
or from one of the mirrors, like:
```bash
pip install "git+git@github.com:baseride/pyZabbixSender.git"
```

Usage
-----

Source code contains samples and comments to allows you start using it in no time. Here's a small example:

```python
# Creating a sender object
z = pyZabbixSender(server="zabbix-server", port=10051)

# Adding data (without timestamp)
z.addData(hostname="test_host", key="test_trap_1", value="12")
z.addData("test_host", "test_trap_2", "2.43")

# Adding data (with timestamp)
z.addData("test_host", "test_trap_2", "2.43", 1365787627)

# Ready to send your data?
results = z.sendData()

# Check if everything was sent as expected
if results[0][0] != z.RC_OK:
  print "oops!"

# Clear internal data to start populating again
z.clearData()

# Wants to send a single data point right now?
z.sendSingle("test_host","test_trap","12")
```

There are some more options, so take a look at the [wiki] page and discover how easy is to use it ;)
